# Introduction

Hashing is the process made by a hash function. This doesn't sounds very helpful, so let's dive into it. 

A hash function is a function that takes an input and returns an output. The output is called hash, and we can affirm that is the output of hashing the input.

# Hashing properties

To consider a function a hash function, it must have the following properties:

I. Deterministic: The same input will always result in the same output. Hashing "hello world" will always result in the same hash.
II. Fixed output length: ...
III. Efficient: ...
IV. Irreversibility: ...
V. Avalanche effect: ...
VI. Pre-image resistance: ...
VII. 2nd pre-image resistance: ...
VIII. Collision resistance: ...
